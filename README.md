A free and open source browser extension for Lectio.

This extension offers numerous QoL[^1] features to Lectio while maintaining most of its familiar appearance and layout. This enables you to use Lectio without having to adapt to a new user interface.

# About

This extensions primary focus is QoL features with a small apperance overhaul. We wanted to provide a FOSS[^2] extension alternative, where every student or teacher using Lectio could participate in the development. 

The open nature of this project also ensures that development can continue past interest of the original developers. With the closed source extension "Lectio Improver" now being abandoned, we feel like this is the optimal time for you to jump aboard and [help](/CONTRIBUTING.md) this project become something **big!**
